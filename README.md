# Juan Azpiazu

**AI-Driven Commercial Strategist | Hospitality Tech Operator | GTM & Automation Builder**

I operate at the intersection of **AI, Revenue Strategy, and Commercial Execution**.

Over the last decade, I’ve worked in hospitality technology helping hotels adopt systems that improve performance. Today, I’m evolving toward designing and building **AI-assisted commercial and operational systems** that enhance decision-making, automate execution, and unlock scalable growth.

This GitHub reflects that transition: from commercial execution → systems thinking.

## What I Do

- Design AI-assisted commercial workflows  
- Build lightweight automation systems (Python, APIs, LLMs)  
- Prototype GTM and revenue tools for hospitality & B2B SaaS  
- Bridge business strategy with technical execution  
- Turn operational friction into scalable systems  

---

## Current Focus (2026 Transition)

- Building AI-driven commercial systems  
- Exploring agentic workflows  
- Integrating LLMs into real business processes  
- Moving from execution → system design & automation  

---

## Domain Expertise

**Hospitality Technology (Hotel SaaS)**  
Revenue & distribution ecosystems  
Enterprise & Mid-Market GTM  
Commercial team enablement  
Territory ownership & pipeline building  

I understand the field realities of:

- Selling complex SaaS
- Owning and scaling territories
- Driving pipeline from scratch
- Aligning product, sales, and revenue strategy

Now I am building the **technical layer to augment commercial execution**.

## Positioning

I am not a pure developer.  
I am not just a commercial profile.  

I operate between:

**Business Strategy × AI × Commercial Execution**

My focus is designing systems that make teams more effective, decisions smarter, and growth scalable.
